# Arduino-Projects
Collection of simple Arduino projects

The main cool .ino is the Mig3 file. I wrote a simple way to grab pwm from a crossfire rc receiver, map the input to an led output. I wanted to control LED's and other output through an arduino. 

The 2nd project here is a Temperature, Humdity, Moisture device. It's the start of an automated data collection and watering project.
